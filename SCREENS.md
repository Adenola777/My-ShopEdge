# The screen register

Written 24 September 2026. **This file is the one the repository relies on for screens.**
Where it disagrees with a count written anywhere else, this file is right, because every
line in it was checked against a source rather than carried forward.

Five things were checked, and each is named against the line it produced:

- The ruling documents `A3`, `A14`, `A15` and `A18`, read for the screen tables and headings.
- `MyShopEdge_Wireframes_and_Workflows.docx`, document MSE-WFW-001 v0.1 dated 20 September,
  whose fifteen screens were extracted as images and three of them opened and read.
- `web/src/app`, listed for what is actually built.
- `design/figma_pending_changeset.js`, read for what the Figma file holds.
- The desktop folder `MYSHOPEDGE`, whose `Dashboard 1` to `6` files were compared image by
  image against the wireframe sheets.

## The counts, corrected

| | Count | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Screen ids defined by a ruling | **38** | S1 to S38 |
| Cut by a later ruling | **2** | S18 and S19, both cut by A15 |
| **Live screens** | **36** | This is the number that matters |
| Wireframed | 15 | S1 to S15 only |
| Built in code | 36 | Every live screen, counted from this register on 29 September. Sign-in works on the live site since 24 September. No screen has shown a real shop's figures, because no shop is connected and nothing reads TikTok's data yet |

**`CLAUDE.md` and `README_v0.2.md` both said "39 screens". That number is wrong twice.**
No ruling defines an S39. The only place S39 appears in the whole repository is
`design/figma_pending_changeset.js`, which is a script rather than a ruling. And the figure
of 39 counts S18 and S19, which A15 cut on 22 September. Both files are corrected.

**"18 screens drawn in Figma" cannot be confirmed or denied.** The Figma account is on the
Starter plan and its tool call limit refuses every read of file `Lv1sLPt9MeE27TeKGy4hOT`.
It refused on 22 September and again on 24 September, so it is a paid gate and not a daily
allowance. What is certain is that the file contains frames, because the pending change set
addresses live node ids for S3, S6, S18, S19 and S39, and that none of those changes were
applied. **Whatever is in Figma predates A15.** Treat it as out of date rather than as a
reference.

## Every screen

`Sheet` is the wireframe sheet in `design/wireframes/`. Each sheet carries two screens side
by side, except the last, which carries S15 alone.

| ID | Screen | Area | Ruled by | Sheet | Built |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Connect TikTok Shop | Onboarding | Wireframes | 02 | `shops`, while no shop is connected, with the return page at `connections/tiktok/callback`. The step dots and the Settings sentence are left out |
| S2 | First sync | Onboarding | Wireframes | 02 | `shops/[shopId]/sync` (28 September). No period on the orders row, and the button leads to Products because S3 is not built |
| S3 | Product costs choice | Onboarding | Wireframes, amended A15.4 | 03 | `shops/[shopId]/setup/costs` (29 September). Buttons only, as A15.4 ruled, with the footnote kept |
| S4 | Upload mapping | Onboarding | Wireframes | 03 | `shops/[shopId]/setup/costs/upload` (29 September). The browser PUTs the file to the signed URL, the seller confirms the columns, and only matched rows are applied. Unmatched rows are listed with the service's reason |
| S5 | Tax profile | Onboarding | Wireframes | 04 | `shops/[shopId]/setup/tax` (29 September). The sheet's sales outside TikTok and last year's income are not asked, because the contract's tax profile holds neither. The first links to S24 |
| S6 | Today | Core | Wireframes, amended A15.5 | 04 | `shops/[shopId]/today` |
| S7 | Stock | Core | Wireframes | 05 | `shops/[shopId]/stock` |
| S8 | Return check | Core | Wireframes | 05 | `shops/[shopId]/returns`, from a link on Stock (28 September). Several waiting items show on one page, one card each, and the "This will" card names the write-off rule rather than a figure, because the service values it |
| S9 | Products | Core | Wireframes, revised A18 | 06 | `shops/[shopId]/products` |
| S10 | Product detail | Core | Wireframes, revised A18 | 06 | `shops/[shopId]/products/[productId]` |
| S11 | Money | Core | Wireframes, revised A18 | 07 | `shops/[shopId]/money` |
| S12 | Tax | Core | Wireframes | 07 | `shops/[shopId]/tax`, the fifth tab (28 September). A threshold monitor, the set-aside estimate of A30.3 with its basis lines, and the tax dates. Each card empties on its own when its reference rules are missing, and production held none on 28 September |
| S13 | Notifications | Core | Wireframes | 08 | `shops/[shopId]/notifications`, reached from the bell. Each open notice can be marked read or done, and the bell's count falls with it (25 September). Rows are not links yet, because a notification carries no address |
| S14 | Discrepancy detail | Core | Wireframes, revised A18 | 08 | `shops/[shopId]/discrepancies`, as a list |
| S15 | Settings and data | Settings | Wireframes | 09 | `shops/[shopId]/settings`, from the top bar (28 September). The "Your data" card is left out, because export, download and deletion are not built |
| S16 | Product transactions | Products | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/products/[productId]/transactions` (28 September) |
| S17 | Start | Account | A3 as Sign up, renamed A14 | | `start`, handing off to Stack's pages at `handler/[...stack]`. No privacy or terms link yet, because neither page exists |
| ~~S18~~ | ~~Return~~ | | **Cut by A15.3** | | |
| ~~S19~~ | ~~Sign in~~ | | **Cut by A15.2** | | |
| S20 | Manual cost entry | Onboarding | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/setup/costs/manual` (29 September), on `listSkuCosts`, added to the contract for it. A zero cost needs a tick. The coverage line is the service's, for the current month |
| S21 | Add or edit a product cost | Products | A3 | | Inline on each variant of `shops/[shopId]/products/[productId]` |
| S22 | Records behind a figure | Money | A3, revised A18 | | `shops/[shopId]/records` |
| S23 | Export | Money | A3, revised A18 | | `shops/[shopId]/money/export`, from Money (29 September). Three kinds only, per A18.6 |
| S24 | Other-channel sales | Money | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/other-sales` (28 September) |
| S25 | Stock adjustment | Stock | A3, revised A18 | | At the top of `shops/[shopId]/stock/[skuId]` |
| S26 | Stock movement history | Stock | A3, revised A18 | | `shops/[shopId]/stock/[skuId]`. The heading names the product, variant and seller SKU (25 September) |
| S27 | Alert settings | Settings | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/settings/alerts` (28 September) |
| S28 | Connection problem | Onboarding | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/connection-problem`, reached from the status on S15 (28 September). Covers the contract's `needs_reconnect`, `disconnected` and `pending` |
| S29 | Disconnect | Settings | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/settings/disconnect` (28 September) |
| S30 | Delete my account | Settings | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/settings/delete`, from S15 (28 September), with `account/closing` for a closing account. Built to A30.1, which supersedes A3's list of what is deleted. The typed email replaces A3's password, which a seller signing in with Google has not got. No data download is offered, because S31 is not built, and the screen says so |
| S31 | Download my data | Settings | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/settings/data`, from S15 and S30 (29 September). One archive holding JSON and CSV, so A3's format choice is not offered |
| S32 | Glossary | Reference | A3 | | `shops/[shopId]/glossary` (28 September) |
| S33 | Plan and card | Onboarding | A14 | | `(site)/billing` |
| S34 | Payment confirmed | Onboarding | A14 | | `(site)/billing/confirmed` |
| S35 | Continue setting up | Account | A14 | | `shops/[shopId]/setup` (29 September). `/shops` sends a seller with a plan and neither a cost nor a tax profile here |
| S36 | That email is already in use | Account | A14 | | `account/email-in-use` (29 September). Reached from any screen that meets `email_already_linked`. No sign-in method is named, because nothing reports it |
| S37 | Signed out | Account | A14 | | `signed-out`, with `?reason=expired` for `token_expired` (29 September) |
| S38 | Payment did not go through | Onboarding | A14 | | `billing/payment-failed`, from `/billing` while past due (29 September). The retry date, the data retention and changing the card are not shown, because nothing holds or does them |

## Where the artwork lives, and what it is worth

`design/wireframes/` holds the fifteen screens as eight PNG sheets and six workflow diagrams,
extracted from the Word document and committed here so that the repository no longer depends
on a file sitting in somebody's chat history or on one desktop.

**They are low fidelity.** The document says so in its own words: they "show structure,
content and behaviour, not final visual design". They are a specification of what is on each
screen, not a specification of how it looks. The visual system is `web/src/app/globals.css`.

**Three of them are known to be out of date.** Each is a later ruling the drawing predates:

| Sheet | Screen | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| 02 | S2 | Shows "Orders, last 12 months". History is twenty four months on every plan |
| 03 | S3 | A15.4 cuts the three cards and keeps the buttons |
| 04 | S6 | A15.5 keeps the congratulation and adds a celebration |

**S16 to S38 have no drawing of any kind.** Twenty one live screens, specified in prose and
never drawn. They are built from their rulings.

## Duplicates that are not extra designs

The desktop folder holds `Dashboard 1.png` through `Dashboard 6.gif`, and five `_5x3`
variants. Compared image by image against the extracted sheets, `Dashboard 1` to `6` are
re-exports of sheets 02 to 07, which is S1 through S12. Perceptual distance was 0 for four
of them and under 5 for the two that were recompressed to JPEG and GIF.

They are the same fifteen screens in a different container. Nothing in that folder is a
design the repository does not already have.

## What this means for building

The written specification is the reference and Figma is not, for as long as the plan limit
stands. That is not a loss worth paying to fix. A low-fidelity wireframe that predates three
rulings would be the weaker reference even if it could be read.

So a screen is built from its ruling, checked against its sheet where one exists, and
checked against the sheet's known staleness above where it applies.

## The seven screens built on 24 September, and what each still lacks

Each was built on a served endpoint, rendered at phone width against the real handlers'
responses to canned rows, and checked in a browser. None has yet run against a real API
with a signed in seller, because the service has no host. What each file leaves out is
written at the top of the file, and summarised here.

| Screen | What is missing | Waiting on |
|---|---|---|
| S6 Today | The VAT line, and the congratulation A15.5 keeps | A29.8 puts VAT out of scope. Nothing tells the screen that onboarding has just finished |
| S7 Stock | The units in hand totals, and the order by what runs out first | `getStock` serves no totals and pages by variant |
| S10 Product detail | The insight, the return rate | No insight source, no return rate in the contract |
| S11 Money | The period switch, expected payouts by week, the export | The contract cannot name a period. Expected payouts need TikTok's unsettled orders. The export needs a file store the service can write to |
| S14 Discrepancy detail | A page for one discrepancy | No endpoint for one discrepancy. The three actions were added on 24 September, and "Correct my record" appears only where the service serves `correctable` |
| S22 Records | The discrepancy marker on affected rows | A ledger entry does not say which discrepancy touches it |
| S26 Movements | The resulting count on each row, the opening balance, links to orders and returns | `getStockMovements` serves no balance. No order or return screen exists |
