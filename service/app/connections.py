"""Connecting a TikTok shop.

Two endpoints. `POST /connections/tiktok/authorize` issues the link that sends a seller to
TikTok, and `GET /connections/tiktok/callback` receives them on the way back.

Every constant here comes from A23, which was read from TikTok's own authorisation page on
23 September 2026 and records nothing inferred. The three that are easy to get wrong:

  * The seller link is `services.tiktokshop.com`, not `partner.tiktokshop.com`. A23.1. Every
    authorisation attempt on 23 September used the partner host and every one of them came
    back with a sandbox shop in Indonesia. MyShopEdge is seller facing.
  * The token exchange is `auth.tiktok-shops.com`, which is not the host every other call
    goes to. A23.3.
  * `grant_type` is `authorized_code`. Not `authorization_code`. A23.3 records TikTok's own
    warning about this, and anybody who knows OAuth will correct it once and break it.

SIGNING
=======

Read from TikTok's own "Sign your API request" and "Common parameters" pages on the evening
of 23 September 2026, through a browser, because those pages are a JavaScript application
and do not render for a plain fetch. That is the only reason the pack went a day without
them. They are public and need no sign in.

A27 records the steps and `_sign` implements them. The one that catches people is the
wrapping: the string is `secret + input + secret` and then that is HMACed with the secret as
the key, so the secret appears three times.

**Unverified against a live call.** The algorithm is implemented from the vendor's stated
steps and no request has yet been made with it. A signature is either accepted or refused,
so the first real call is the test. Until then treat `_sign` as written but not proven.
