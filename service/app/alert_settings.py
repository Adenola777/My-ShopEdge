"""Alert settings, S27. The thresholds behind the stock states and the absorption ceiling.

Written by Emergent AI in `Adenola777/MYSHOPEDGE` (commit 3f1bd43, 27 September 2026) and
brought into this repository on 28 September at the owner's instruction, after review in
`audit/EMERGENT_review_28_september.md`. One change on the way in: the default answer's
`updated_at` is `now_utc()`, where Emergent used a naive `datetime.now()`.

`getAlertSettings` (STK-3) and `putAlertSettings` (STK-3, STK-8). Both run inside the
seller's own scope through `tenant()`, so the settings are bound to the shop by row-level
security and never taken from the request.

Defaults are served when no row exists, so a shop that has never set thresholds still reads
a complete answer rather than a 404. The defaults are the table's own column defaults
(14 low-stock days, 7 coming-back days, 20 units of absorption tolerance), so the answer
before a save matches the behaviour the stock endpoints already apply.

A PUT is a full replacement. The ranges are enforced by the request model, so a value
outside them is a 422 before any row is touched.
