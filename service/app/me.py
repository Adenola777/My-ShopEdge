"""Who is signed in, and which shops they have. `getMe` and `listShops`.

Every shop screen carries a shop id in its address, and until these two existed nothing
gave a signed-in seller that id. Both read only the caller's own rows, through `tenant()`,
so neither takes an id from the request.

WHAT IS LEFT OUT, AND WHY

`Account.tax_profile_completed` is optional in the contract and is not served. No document
says what makes a tax profile complete, since every column in `tax_profiles` except the
flag is nullable. A guess would drive a prompt the seller acts on.

`Shop.authorization_expires_at` is served as null. CLAUDE.md records that nobody has checked
whether it is the same instant as `tiktok_connections.refresh_expires_at`, and one real
authorisation settles it. Serving the refresh expiry under that name would be the guess.

A shop whose `connection_status` is `deleted` is not listed, which matches `require_shop`.
The contract's enum has no `deleted`, because a deleted shop is gone as far as the seller
is concerned.

Checked on the development branch, 24 September 2026, with the SQL below: one account,
one shop.
