"""The Money screen, S11. The calculator for the whole shop.

The order of the calculator is A8.5's, and it is fixed:

    Gross sales, less seller discounts           = Net sales
    less TikTok fees                             = Net proceeds before refunds
    less refunds to customers                    = Net proceeds
    less cost of goods sold and your postage     = Gross profit
    less return shipping and stock written off   = Gross profit after returns

Four things the rulings left open were decided by the owner on 24 September 2026, and each
is applied here as decided rather than inferred.

1. **Platform adjustments sit inside TikTok fees**, each on its own line under TikTok's own
   adjustment type. A8.5 had no place for them. They carry no SKU, which is why the product
   endpoints never met them.
2. **Reserves and the payout are a final section**, after the chain. A18.3 wants net
   proceeds, reserve withheld and payout shown in that order, and MoneyView has no field
   for them, so they travel in the existing CalculatorSection shape and the contract is
   unchanged. The amounts are the ledger's own, signs included: a payout is recorded as
   money leaving the ledger for the bank, so it is negative. Whether the screen shows it
   with its sign flipped is a presentation question that is still open.
3. **`cost_coverage` is a share of products.** Products sold in the period with a cost for
   every variant, divided by products sold. That is the "N of M products" half of CST-6.
4. **Confidence follows the basis.** Cash basis counts settled money only, so it is
   confirmed. Sales basis is estimated when any sale, refund or TikTok deduction in the
   period has no settlement yet. Either is incomplete when a sold product lacks a cost,
   because the figure that needs the cost is then null.

Cost of goods sold is computed, not read. It is the product cost times units sold less
units returned, per SKU, which is A4's retained cost and the same arithmetic the product
endpoints use. The `cost_of_goods_sold` ledger entries are posted for every unit including
the ones that came back, so reading them would count a returned unit twice (A4.1).

When costs are incomplete the chain stops at Net proceeds. The two cost sections still
appear, each with its own total under A8.5's section labels, and gross profit is null
rather than a figure that silently leaves the goods out.

`granularity` is accepted and echoed. MoneyView carries no series, so nothing is bucketed
by it. What the parameter should change on this response is not stated in the contract or
in any ruling, and it is recorded here as unanswered rather than guessed.

**Verified by the smoke test only.** The handler has run against canned rows. It has not
run against the development branch, whose ledger has `settlement_month` empty on every
row because `testdata/seed.sql` omits that column, so the cash basis there returns nothing.
