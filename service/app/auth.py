"""Turning a request into an account.

Neon Auth provisions **Stack Auth** on this project, which issues the tokens. That is the
`auth_provider` value in the project's own Neon Auth configuration, not an inference from a
documentation page. This service never sees a password, never issues a token, and never
stores one. The only thing about a seller's
identity that reaches our database is ``accounts.auth_subject``.

The chain, and the rule that holds it together.

    1. The request carries a bearer JWT.
    2. This module verifies the signature against the provider's published keys, and checks
       issuer, audience and expiry.
    3. The ``sub`` claim of the verified token is the only identity input accepted.
    4. resolve_account turns that subject into an account id.
    5. Every query then runs inside db.tenant(account_id).

The rule is step 3. An account id is never read from a header, a body, a query string or a
cookie, because anything a client can set is something a client can forge. The subject is
taken from the token after verification and from nowhere else.

**The algorithm, and how it was got wrong twice in one day.**

This module first verified ES256 and RS256. On 23 September I narrowed it to EdDSA,
believing Neon Auth provisions Better Auth, and rewrote the tests to sign EdDSA. Every case
passed. Every real token would have been refused, because the provider signs ES256.

The provider's own JWKS, fetched the same evening from the `jwks_url` in this project's
Neon Auth configuration and recorded at `tests/fixtures/provider_jwks_2026-09-23.json`::

    {"kty":"EC","crv":"P-256","alg":"ES256","kid":"LhlLhcwrLjOE", ...}

Both mistakes had the same shape. A vendor page was read, the code was changed to match it,
and the test was changed to match the code. A test that generates its own key can only
confirm that the code agrees with the test. The configuration was one call away on both
occasions.

The test now asserts `ALGORITHMS` against that recorded JWKS, so changing this value
without refetching the provider's keys fails in either direction.

**The email.** This module read ``claims["email"]`` and refused the seller without it, on
the strength of Neon's overview page saying managed tokens carry "no custom claims". The
JWT plugin page contradicts that and lists the payload: ``iat``, ``name``, ``email``,
``emailVerified``, ``image``, ``createdAt``, ``updatedAt``, ``role``, ``banned``,
``banReason``, ``banExpires``, ``id``, ``sub``, ``exp``, ``iss`` and ``aud``. The email is
there.

Two pages of the same vendor's documentation disagree, so this module trusts neither and
takes the claim when it is present and ``neon_auth.users_sync`` when it is not. That is
correct whichever page is right, and it survives the provider changing its mind.

``emailVerified`` matters more than ``email``. An unverified address is a claim by whoever
signed up, not a fact, and a financial product must not attach a seller's payout history to
an address nobody has proved they control. Where the claim is present and false, the seller
is refused until they verify.

**Issuer and audience are configured, not derived.** They used to default to the origin of
the Neon Auth URL, which came from the same page that named the wrong provider. What Stack
Auth puts in ``iss`` and ``aud`` has never been observed here, because no real token has
ever reached this service. Guessing would mean refusing every valid token, or accepting one
issued for somebody else. So ``NEON_AUTH_AUDIENCE`` and ``NEON_AUTH_ISSUER`` must both be
set, read off a real token once, and the service refuses to verify until they are.
