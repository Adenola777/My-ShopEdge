"""Notifications. `listNotifications` and `updateNotification`, tracing NTF-1.

Notifications belong to the account, not to one shop, so both operations are scoped by
`tenant()` alone and take no shop id. The row level security policy on `notifications` is
`account_id = app_account_id()`, checked on the development branch on 24 September.

`unread_count` counts every unread notification on the account, whatever the page's
filters, for the reason `open_count` does on discrepancies: a count that fell when the
seller filtered would read as problems dealt with.

THE ONE WAY TRANSITION

The contract says a notification cannot return to unread. **Derived, not ruled:** the order
unread, read, done is treated as one way throughout, so done cannot go back to read either,
because the contract's reason ("a seller cannot lose track of what they have already dealt
with") applies to done at least as much as to read. Setting the status a notification
already has is accepted and changes nothing, so a repeated request is harmless.

Nothing writes notifications yet. The development branch holds none, so these operations
return an empty list there until the sweep that raises them is built.
