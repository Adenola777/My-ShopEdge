"""The only way this service reaches the database.

Every query a request makes runs inside ``tenant()``. There is no second accessor, and no
endpoint is given a raw connection, because the one thing that must never be forgotten is
the line that scopes a connection to one seller.

What ``tenant()`` does before yielding, and why each part matters.

    set local role mse_app;
    select set_config('app.account_id', %s, true);

``mse_app`` is the only role the service ever runs as. It cannot update or delete a ledger
entry, it cannot read the migration ledger, and it owns nothing. ``LOCAL`` on both means
they are undone when the transaction ends, so a pooled connection handed to the next
request carries nothing from this one.

The scoping fails closed rather than open. ``app_account_id()`` is defined as
``nullif(current_setting('app.account_id', true), '')::uuid``, so an unset context is null,
and the policy ``id = app_account_id()`` is then true for no row at all. Verified on the
development branch on 22 September 2026: the right account sees 20 orders, a different
account sees 0, and no context set sees 0.
