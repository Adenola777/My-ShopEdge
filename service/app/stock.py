"""Stock. What is on the shelf, how long it lasts, and every movement behind the count.

Two operations, `getStock` and `getStockMovements`, tracing STK-1, STK-2 and STK-4.

WHAT IS STORED AND WHAT IS DERIVED

`stock_positions` stores TikTok's count, the seller's adjustment and three counters. The
database computes `on_shelf` as TikTok stock plus the adjustment, and this module returns it
as stored. Two figures are derived here: `days_left` and `state`.

DAYS LEFT, STK-2

The PRD's user story US-08 asks for Days left "on a 14-day pace". The QA document's worked
example G8 divides by thirty days instead (438 sold in 30 days, 14.6 a day, 5.6 days). The
PRD is product authority under A29.11, so the pace here is fourteen days. The conflict is
recorded rather than resolved silently, and the window is one constant.

    days_left = on_shelf / (units sold in the last 14 London days / 14)

Units sold are the quantities on order lines of orders that were not cancelled, dated by
`business_today()` in Europe/London (A29.9). Days left is null when nothing sold in the
window, and null when nothing is on the shelf, which is the A12 row 29 requirement that a
sold out product returns null rather than a division.

**Unverified against the rule in one respect.** TC-STK-02 excludes days on which the SKU
had no stock from the average. Nothing in the schema records a daily stock level, so the
exclusion cannot be applied. For a SKU that was out of stock for part of the window, the
rate here is lower than the rule's and Days left is therefore longer than it should be.
Returned units are not subtracted from the pace either, because no document says whether
they should be.

STATE

The contract names four states and no document orders them. The order applied here is
derived, not ruled:

    out          on_shelf is zero or below
    low          days_left is below the seller's low stock threshold
    coming_back  units are on their way back from a return
    healthy      none of the above

The threshold is `alert_settings.low_stock_days`, and 14 when the seller has never set one,
which is the column's own default. Out is first because it is the state a seller must act
on. Low comes before coming back because units in transit do not stop a shelf emptying.

Checked on the development branch, 24 September 2026. Ten positions, one of them GIFT-DEF
at 0 and therefore out. Every seeded order falls in July or August, so no SKU sold in the
fourteen days to 24 September, every `days_left` is null, and the other nine are healthy.
That is correct for the data and it means the low state has not yet been seen on real rows.
