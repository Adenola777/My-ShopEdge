"""The Today screen, S6. The hero figure, the month, Shop Money and what needs the seller.

Every figure here is either the Money calculator for a period or a count read live from
the tables. Nothing is estimated in this file. The rules below were decided by the owner on
24 September 2026, because DSH-1, DSH-2 and DSH-10 left them open.

**Labels follow A8.** The hero is `gross_profit_after_returns` when every product sold
today has a cost, and `net_proceeds` otherwise. A8 withdrew both "You keep" and "Left after
TikTok", so neither appears. The value is null only if the calculator cannot produce the
figure the label names.

**The day is Europe/London.** A5 defines Today as the current local date in Europe/London
from midnight to the as-at time. The month is the calendar month that day falls in.

**Shop Money covers all time**, and it reconciles to what TikTok actually paid (A29.7).
Generated is the same net proceeds the calculator reaches, over every ledger entry the shop
holds. Return postage TikTok deducted in its statements, the `return_shipping` entries
carrying TikTok's field `return_shipping_fee_amount`, is stated as `return_postage`. Paid out
is everything on entries TikTok has settled, postage included, so it equals the payout.
Awaiting is the rest, broken down by TikTok's own sub-statuses in `order_settlements`. Paid
out plus awaiting equals generated plus return postage, by construction. Postage the seller
paid outside TikTok never passes through a statement and is outside Shop Money.

**Freshness**, A29.3. Under 6 hours since the last successful sync is `fresh`, 6 to 24
hours inclusive is `getting_old`, and over 24 hours or never synced is `stale`. `stale` is
true exactly when the status is `stale`.

**Needs you** is counted live on every request and ordered critical, then warning, then
info, then by the amount at stake, then by count. The items are counts rather than events,
so they carry no single time, and the tie ends at the count. A29.6 holds the full table.
Four severities are derived from the owner's definitions rather than named by him: open
discrepancies, unmapped fees and returns to check as warnings, out of stock as info.

**The order count**, A16.3, is read from `order_usage.read_order_usage` and served as
`order_usage`. It is the account's count, not the shop's, because the plan is the account's.
Today only reads it; the notice at 100 per cent is written by the sync.

**Requires migration 0022**, which adds the refresh and scope columns and the `partial`
sync status. Until 0022 is applied, this handler fails on the query that reads them. The
missing scope item cannot fire until `required_scopes` holds a decided list (A29.4).
`COST_PRICE_UPDATE_RECOMMENDED` is not served, because nothing records when a cost is stale.

**Verified by the smoke test only.** The queries were run on the development branch, as
recorded in the pull request. The handler itself has not run against a real database.
