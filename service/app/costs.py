"""Cost prices. `putSkuCost` and `getCostCoverage`.

A missing cost makes gross profit after returns unknown for that product, and every screen
that shows the figure tells the seller so. These two operations are where the seller acts
on that, one variant at a time.

SETTING A COST NEVER OVERWRITES ONE

The contract (CST-1, CST-4, CST-5) says costs are never overwritten. The current cost is
stamped `superseded_at` and a new row is inserted, inside one transaction. The unique index
`product_costs_current_idx` allows one current cost per variant, so two concurrent writes
cannot both leave a current row: the second fails rather than doubling the cost.

The contract also says a figure calculated last month still reconciles against the cost in
force at the time. Until 28 September the figure queries in `products.py` read only the
current cost, so a new cost changed past months' gross profit too. On 28 September the
owner approved taking Emergent AI's change (commit d87f6a0): the figures and coverage read
the cost in force at the period's end, by `effective_from`, with `created_at` as the
tie-break for two rows on one day. It is the cost at the end of the period, not at each
sale's date, so a cost that changes inside a month applies to the whole of that month.

A cost in a currency other than the shop's is refused. `cost_minor` is summed with sales
in the shop's currency, and adding pence to cents would be a wrong figure presented as a
right one.

COVERAGE, CST-6

The contract defines coverage as the share of sold units whose cost is known, over the
period. Units are order line quantities on orders that were not cancelled, dated in
Europe/London (A29.9), the same way `stock.py` counts its pace. The `top_missing` list is
ordered by gross sales, because the contract describes it as the products whose missing
cost suppresses the most figures, and gross sales is the size of the figure suppressed.

Both queries were run on the development branch, 24 September 2026.
