"""Idempotency-Key, as the contract's IdempotencyKey parameter promises it.

"A repeat with the same key returns the first result rather than acting twice. Keys are
retained for 24 hours." The key is stored with the first response inside the same
transaction as the write, so a write and its key are recorded together or not at all.

A repeat whose body differs from the first is refused with 422. Returning the first result
to a different request would tell the caller that the second request succeeded.

Needs migration 0023, which is **not yet applied**. A request without a key never touches
the table, so it works before 0023 is applied.
