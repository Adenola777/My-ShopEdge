"""Sales made outside TikTok Shop, S24. `listOtherChannelSales` and `putOtherChannelSales`.

Written by Emergent AI in `Adenola777/MYSHOPEDGE` (commit 3f1bd43, 27 September 2026) and
brought into this repository on 28 September at the owner's instruction, after review in
`audit/EMERGENT_review_28_september.md`. One change on the way in: a figure in a currency
other than the shop's is refused, because the table stores no currency and Emergent's
version stored the amount and echoed back whatever currency the caller sent.

Traces MON-3. These figures never enter the ledger and never appear in a money view. They
exist only so the VAT threshold monitor measures total turnover rather than TikTok turnover
alone, which `tax.get_vat_monitor` already reads from `other_channel_sales`.

Both run inside the seller's own scope. A month is stored as the first day of the London
month, which the table's own CHECK enforces. Money is minor units and never a float.

The list groups by month and sums every channel, because the screen shows the total a month
carries and the monitor sums the same rows. The PUT is per channel within a month and is an
upsert on `(shop_id, channel, month)`, so re-entering a channel's figure corrects it rather
than adding a second row.
