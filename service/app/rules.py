"""Reference rules, shared and read-only. `listRules`, tracing TAX-6.

Written by Emergent AI in `Adenola777/MYSHOPEDGE` (commit 3f1bd43, 27 September 2026) and
brought into this repository on 28 September at the owner's instruction, after review in
`audit/EMERGENT_review_28_september.md`. One change on the way in: the default date is
`business_today()`, the London date (A29.9), where Emergent used `date.today()`, the
server's date.

`reference_rules` is the one table without row-level security, because its rows are the
same for every seller: the VAT threshold, income tax and National Insurance rules, and the
MTD rules, each with the date it takes effect. This endpoint reads them and never writes.

It runs unscoped rather than through `tenant()`, because the rows belong to no account and
`app.account_id` is irrelevant to them. `mse_app` holds SELECT on the table and nothing
more.
