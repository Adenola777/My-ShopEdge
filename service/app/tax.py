"""Tax. The profile, the VAT threshold monitor, and the set-aside estimate.

Written by Emergent AI in `Adenola777/MYSHOPEDGE` (commits 91aeed4, 25 September, and
3f1bd43, 27 September 2026) and brought into this repository unchanged on 28 September at
the owner's instruction, after review in `audit/EMERGENT_review_28_september.md`.

Traces TAX-1, TAX-2 and TAX-3. This module monitors a threshold and estimates a set-aside.
It does not prepare or submit a VAT return and it does not account for VAT on a registered
seller's behalf, both of which PRD 6.2 excludes.

The VAT registration threshold is not held in code. It is a reference rule, read from
`reference_rules` with its own `reviewed_at`, because a threshold that a release hard-codes
is one a release has to change. The current value, GBP 90,000 from 1 April 2024, is HMRC's
under the Value Added Tax (Increase of Registration Limits) Order 2024.

The set-aside amount needs the income tax and National Insurance reference rules, and a
ruling on the method. Neither exists yet, so the estimate is returned as null with a reason
rather than as a guessed figure. A seller who under-saves on a made-up number has been
failed by the product, which is TAX-3's own warning.
