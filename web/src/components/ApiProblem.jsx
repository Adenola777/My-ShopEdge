/**
 * The states a screen shows when the API does not give it figures.
 *
 * Every reading screen distinguishes four outcomes, because each tells the seller something
 * different: the service could not be reached, the session ended, the shop or record is not
 * theirs, or the service answered with an error. Rendering any of them as an empty list
 * would tell a seller their shop is empty, which is the one reading that is never true.
 *
 * The wording states only what is known. On 24 September two screens were found claiming
 * "your data is safe" when nothing had checked it, so no message here makes a claim about
 * the seller's data.
