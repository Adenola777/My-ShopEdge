/**
 * Where TikTok sends a seller back after they approve MyShopEdge.
 *
 * TikTok redirects the browser here with `code` and `state`. This page, on the server, hands
 * both to the service's `tiktokCallback`, which spends the state, exchanges the code, stores
 * the encrypted tokens and creates the shop, then tells the seller what happened in words.
 *
 * Why the redirect lands here and not on the service. The service answers `tiktokCallback`
 * with JSON, as the contract says, so a browser sent straight to it shows the seller a page
 * of raw data. Landing here keeps the contract as it is and gives the seller a screen. The
 * callback URL registered in TikTok Partner Center must therefore be this path on the app's
 * address: `https://app.myshopedge.inspirecraftglobal.com/connections/tiktok/callback` since
 * 30 September 2026, when the owner set it, and the `vercel.app` address before that. The
 * path is the one the runbook named on 23 September before any code existed.
 *
 * The page is not behind sign-in, because `tiktokCallback` carries `security: []`: the
 * state is what binds the result to the seller who started it.
 *
 * **Unverified against TikTok.** No real authorisation has passed through this page. What
 * TikTok puts in the address when a seller declines is not recorded in A23, so any arrival
 * without both `code` and `state` is treated as a connection that did not complete.
