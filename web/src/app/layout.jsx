/**
 * The root layout: the document, the fonts, the icons, sign-in, and the footer.
 *
 * The top bar is not drawn here. Inside a shop it carries the Updated stamp and the bell,
 * which need the shop, so each area draws its own: `(site)/layout.jsx` and
 * `shops/(list)/layout.jsx` without them, `shops/[shopId]/layout.jsx` with them.
 *
 * Until 24 September this layout drew its own line icon, set "MyShopEdge" in a font and set
 * "Know Your Numbers." beside it with a full stop. A7.6 forbids all three. The logo now
 * comes from `brand/`, and the icons and manifest are the ones A7.3 built
 * (`brand/head-snippet.html`).
 *
 * Fonts, WFW 1.1: Plus Jakarta Sans for text and Archivo for figures, self-hosted from the
 * @fontsource packages, so no request leaves for a font service.
