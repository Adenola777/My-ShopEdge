/**
 * S14 Discrepancies. Where TikTok and the seller's record disagree, and which value is in
 * use meanwhile.
 *
 * The contract has no endpoint for one discrepancy, so each discrepancy is shown in full on
 * this list rather than on a page of its own. `open_count` is the shop's whole open count,
 * whatever the filter, as TC-DSC-05 requires.
 *
 * An unmapped fee is not a disagreement. It has only TikTok's side (A18.4), so it is
 * explained as a fee MyShopEdge does not recognise, and it says plainly that the seller has
 * done nothing wrong and that the money is counted.
 *
 * The three actions on the wireframe (accept TikTok's value, correct my record, mark as
 * explained) go through `resolveDiscrepancy`. "Correct my record" appears only where the
 * service says the fact is the seller's own (`correctable`).
