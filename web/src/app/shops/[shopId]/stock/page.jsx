/**
 * S7 Stock. What is on hand for each variant, its state and its days of cover.
 *
 * The state and days of cover are computed by `getStock` (service/app/stock.py) and shown as
 * they arrive. The labels are A8's: stock on hand, sold not yet dispatched, returns in
 * transit, stock written off and days of cover.
 *
 * Two parts of the wireframe are not here yet, and both wait on the contract rather than
 * on this screen. The "Units in hand" block is a set of totals across every variant, and
 * `getStock` serves no totals. Adding them up here would put a figure in the browser that
 * the service never computed, against A29.1. "What runs out first" is an ordering by days
 * of cover, and the endpoint pages by variant, so an ordering applied here would sort only
 * the page in hand.
