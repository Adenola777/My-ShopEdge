/**
 * S9 Products, drawn to wireframe sheet 06 (redrawn 24 September after the design audit).
 *
 * The sheet: the title and what the ranking is by; a measure switch; one row per product
 * with its figure on the right; uncosted products below the ranked ones with "Add cost".
 *
 * The measure switch is served, because `listProducts` takes `measure`. The ranking comes
 * from the service in its order (A29.1). Uncosted products are listed after the ranked
 * ones, as the sheet shows, by the `cost_known` flag the service returns.
 *
 * **Not yet as the sheet shows.** Each row on the sheet carries a pence-in-the-pound bar
 * split into stock, postage, TikTok and what is left. That split is a financial rule, so it
 * belongs in the service and waits for phase 3 of the audit, which adds it to the contract.
 *
 * A product with no cost shows no profit, never £0.00: `Figure` renders the reason.
 *
 * **Money tied to no product has its own line**, as the owner ruled on 25 September 2026.
 * A platform adjustment TikTok applies to a whole statement belongs to the shop and to no
 * product, so the products alone do not add up to Money. The service returns those lines
 * as `unattributed` and the sum as `shop_total`, and the screen shows both beneath the
 * products, so the last figure on this screen is the one Money shows for the same period.
